
dIngle - VERSION 0.5001

dIngle is a library for developing applications which
are build around a global namespace for function calls.

This programming paradigm has sometimes a bad reputation,
nonetheless you can tackle some problems easier with this approach as with
a totally modularized one.

Use cases for now are:

* Generation of text files for example for templates of a
  dynamic website.
* A very simple continuous integration server.
